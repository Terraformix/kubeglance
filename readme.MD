I've recently completed an end-to-end Kubernetes dashboard solution that enables teams to gain real-time insights into their clusters by simply uploading a kubeconfig file. This tool provides comprehensive visibility into deployments, pods, services, configmaps, namespaces and their statuses - making cluster management dramatically more efficient.

I took a "shift-left" approach to security, integrating it at every stage:

𝗚𝗜𝗧 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Implemented Gitleak to scan commits for credentials and secrets that exist in code changes 🔍
𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Set up SonarQube for static code analysis with quality gates 📊
𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁/𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: Created Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies to validate Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifest configurations 📋
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: Implemented Trivy scanning for base images and dependencies 🔎
𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗰: Used Kubesec validate Kubernetes manifests against security best practices 🛡️

𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 ☁️

• Architected a multi-cloud deployment solution spanning both AWS and GCP 🌐
• Used Terraform to provision infrastructure including:
• VPCs, subnets, and security groups 🔒
• Kubernetes clusters 🎛️
• Virtual Machines 💻
• Container Registries 📦

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 🔧

• Used Ansible to automate consistent environment setup
• Developed playbooks for software installation and configuration ⚙️
